# Recipe API Project

This project is run in the command line. You can search a recipe using an ingredient and filter by calories. 

If the search isn't specific enough, you can narrow it further with another ingredient search. 

The final recipe links are saved to a text file.

Open up your terminal or cmd prompt, and run project-calories.py
